# daily-plannit

Given base html supplied with choice of font, boot strap, jquery and moment

created sections within the body to use as rows for the given container element. 

applied appropriate classes and id's to work with the given programs (such as past, present and future)as well as some unique ones to fit with personal style choices

defined each hour in 24 hour format to work easier with moment, but have them visibly listed in 12 hour format for better viewing experience

created a function to go through 'each' row to color code them based on time of day

-set the time display to change in real time but chose to not show seconds to keep it cleaner

used JSON to parse local storage on page load to keep track of saved events, using a click funtion to save the user input
